Keyboard target replaces keywords surrounded by : with emojis 
For example ":happy:" gets replaced with "ðŸ˜„" automatically using this custom keyboard 

Here's a live demo: (Please excuse the horrible quality of the gif)

Note: since this is fuzzy in the above gif, the keyword must be typed between two colons, and the keyboard will then replace the word with the emoji. The second colon cannot be disregarded. It was entered in the demo as well however the horrible gif quality did not accurately show that.
